## Welcome to GitHub Pages

The presented artifacts from CS 320: Automation and Quality Assurance in addition to CS 405: Secure Coding demonstrate vulnerability mitigation strategies. 
Vulnerability mitigation assists with implementing nonpermanent solutions for eliminating possible exploits. 
The use of vulnerability mitigation then prioritizes security before exploits are manipulated by attackers. 
Within this page, the viewer will find ways to mitigate common programming issues and will gain insight into how I eliminate software exploits.
